# kidneydisorder
Kidney disease, also known as a "silent disease", often has few or no symptoms in the early stages. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms may include: 
Swelling
Swelling in the hands, feet, ankles, or legs due to water retention (oedema) 
Urine changes
Changes in the frequency or quantity of urine, especially at night, or blood in the urine 
Pain
Pain in the back, under the lower ribs, or pain or burning when urinating 
Other symptoms
Weight loss, poor appetite, tiredness, shortness of breath, difficulty sleeping, itchy skin, nausea, vomiting, and muscle cramps 
Kidney disease can go undiagnosed until a blood or urine test is performed for another reason. In stage 2 of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidneys are still working well, so there may not be any symptoms. However, there may be other signs of kidney damage, such as protein in the urine. 
Electrolyte imbalances can result from impaired kidney function. For example, low calcium levels and poorly controlled phosphorus may contribute to muscle cramping.
